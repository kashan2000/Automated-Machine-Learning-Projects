# Automated-Machine-Learning-Projects

### This Repository contains all the Projects which I made first ML Algorithms then demonstrated how to create them with Auto ML Libraries.
## The Auto ML Libraries I have used in these projects are:
1) Auto Sk Learn
2) Auto Keras
3) PyCaret
4) H2O Auto ML
5) TPOT 
6) Eval ML

## Project Details:
1) Bank Customer Churn Prediction using H2O Auto ML : Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn
2) Bike Rental Count Prediction uisng ML and H2O Auto ML : The objective of this Case is to Predication of bike rental count on daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings
3) Credit Card Fraud Detection using PyCaret : In this project we will be first making our redictions using Machine Learning Techniques then we will be using Auto ML Technique to do the same. We will be using PyCaret in this notebook.
4) Flight Fare Prediction using Auto SK Learn : In this project we will be predicting the Fare of a flight a person has to give on inputting the data using the normal Machine Learning techniques then we will see how we can do the same thing with the help of using Auto SK Learn which is a Auto ML Library.
5) IPL Score Prediction using ML and TPOT(Auto ML Library) : Predicts the score of a match if sufficient conditons are given.
6) Petrol Price Forecasting using Tensor Flow and Auto Keras :  LSTM and ARIMA forecasting models are used to predict the prices then we will see how we can implement the same using Auto Keras, which is an Auto ML Library
7) Pizza_Price_Prediction uisng ML and EVAL Auto ML : In this project we will be building a model which will predict the prices of data based on different parameters such as number of toppings, diameter, etc.
